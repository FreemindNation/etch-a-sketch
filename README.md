This project is part of my learning while completing the Odin Project curriculum.
The aim of the project is to create a browser version of an etch-a-sketch. 
 The project is created using html, css and javaScript. It is a simple web version of an etch-a-sketch where you can draw by holding the mouse down and moving it over grid. You have the option of changing the pen's colour and well the background colour of the grind.
 the etch-a-sketch has three other modes where you can choose rainbow colour, opacity level as well as the option to erase some or all of your drawings so far.
 There is also a range meter to change the grid size as well a clear button to clear everything and reset grid size, pen colour as well as background colour to their default settings.

 Most of the methods used were learned as part of the Odin Project but i have had to search through the web for a few things.
